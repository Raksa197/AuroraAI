-User Registration: Users will be able to create an account on the website, providing their necessary information for authentication and access to avatar generation features.
-Image Upload: Users will have the ability to upload a minimum of 10 images of themselves, which will be used for avatar generation.
-Avatar Generation: The website will utilize advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to generate personalized avatar images based on the uploaded images.
-Customization: Users will be able to customize their avatar images by providing prompts that influence the generation process.
-Secure Payment System: Integration of a secure payment system to handle credit card information for user authentication.
